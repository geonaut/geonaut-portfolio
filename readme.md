Source Code for Geonaut.co.uk
=============================

This is the source code for my personal portolio site, written in Python. It is relatively simple and lightweight, and makes use of the Django framework and Wagtail CMS for managing content. 

The site also uses:

  * Bootstrap v3
  * JavaScript incl. JQuery
  * Taggit for tags
  * Formspree as a lightweight SMTP relay
  * Django Bootstrap Pagination

To Do List
==========

1. Move homepage copy into CMS
1. Dynamically fetch categories to create filter switches
1. Find a more reliable way to display PDFs
1. Sort script blocking on above-fold content
1. Set on_delete values for on_delete action
